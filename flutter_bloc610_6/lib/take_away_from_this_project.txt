1. Each Widget Has Its Own Context
Every widget in Flutter is associated with a BuildContext. However, not all contexts are the same, as they depend on their position in the widget tree.

2. Explicit and Implicit Context Usage
Some widgets require you to explicitly use the BuildContext for certain operations. Even if a context isn't explicitly passed, every widget inherently has an associated context.

3. Parent-Child Context Relationship
A child widget's context is linked to its parent widget's context. Functions like Navigator.of(context) or BlocProvider.of<Type>(context) traverse the widget tree from the current context upwards to find the relevant parent context based on type.

4. Role of Context in Widget Tree and Theme
Beyond navigation or dependency injection, BuildContext is crucial for maintaining the widget tree, accessing themes, localization, and other inherited properties.
